# Practice-Dice-Roller

### In Just A Few Steps
- Download and install Android Studio [ [Downloads](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) ]
- Open Android Studio and create a new project (empty activity), you can learn from these courses [ [Reference](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-kotlin-four?authuser=2) ]
- or clone from [android-basics-kotlin-dice-roller-with-images-app-solution](https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-basics-kotlin-dice-roller-with-images-app-solution) by [google-developer-training](https://github.com/google-developer-training)


### More Practice
- Add another dice to the app, so that one Roll button gives 2 dice results. How many ImageViews will you need in your layout? How will that affect the MainActivity.kt code?
